# **PyModule**

This is a C++ Python module skeleton using `boost::python` .

## :cupid: **Build and Instal**

The shared C++ library (Python module) is built and instaled by means of the `make.bash` script (root privileges asked).

## :broken_heart: **Remove and Clean**

It is uninstaled and the build directory is cleaned by means of the `clean.bash` script (root privileges asked).

## :dizzy: Have fun! :dizzy:

Implement your own code, use other C++ libraries and access everything from Python.
